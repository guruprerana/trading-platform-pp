# Ubuntu build guide

Run the following commands on the terminal:

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install qt5-default
```

Now, if your IDE is Qt Creator, you have finished. All you need to do is to open `src\trading-platform-pp.pro` with `Qt Creator`, and then `build` it.

If that is not the case, you need to run `scripts\build.sh`.
